Then, you can add as many pokemons as you want. Not that you need to respect the architecture of pokemons. 

You need to add icons of pokemons on the /images/icons folder (only webp format)
You need to add images of pokemons on the /images/profil folder (only png format)
In both case, the name of the image must be the same as the id of the pokemon.
